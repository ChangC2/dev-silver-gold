                controversies arising out of or relating to the Agreement, including your
                use of any Services, shall be submitted first to JAMS for mediation at

                offices of JAMS as hereinafter provided. Either you or the Company may

                request for mediation, setting forth the subject of the dispute and the

                charges. All offers, promises, conduct and statements, whether oral or

                solely and exclusively via binding arbitration at the Chicago offices of
                JAMS. You or the Company may initiate arbitration at any time following
                45 days from the initial mediation session (&quot;Earliest Initiation
                Date&quot;). At no time prior to the Earliest Initiation Date shall you
                or the Company initiate arbitration related to this Agreement except to
                pursue a provisional remedy that is authorized by JAMS Rules. However,
                this limitation is inapplicable if either you or the Company refuses to
                comply with the requirements of mediation described above. The arbitration
                shall be before one arbitrator and shall be administered by JAMS pursuant
                to its Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures. All legal actions in
